This guide is written and maintained by Esther Onfroy &amp;amp; Abir Ghattas.
Why? People are struggling to analyze iOS devices due to the complexity of the procedure on Linux. We have decided to use Docker because latest versions of iOS require the use of a version of libimobiledevice which is not available on Linux yet.</description></item></channel></rss>
